# Multi-Modal Approach Based on Deep Convolutional Networks for the Classification of Chest Radiology Examinations
This work was developed in the context of a MSc thesis at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, University of Lisbon.
The code is not meant to be used for commercial purposes.

The source code in this project leverages the keras.io deep learning libray for implementing a deep neural network that combines word embeddings,
recurrent units, and neural attention, together with state-of-the-art CNN networks, for the task of classify Chest Radiology Examinations.

The complete multi-modal model with pre-trained weights (i.e. image processing path pre-trained with CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR, and text modeling path pre-trained with MIMIC-III dataset) and fine-tuned with the open-i training split, achieved a very high performance in terms of the different metrics. Pre-training, in particular, contributed significantly to the overall performance of the complete model.

# Instructions:
  *The Dataset folder provides the scripts necessary to preprocess the MIMIC-CXR, MIMIC-III, and Open-i datasets described in our experiments.
  
  *The Text_Model, Image_Model folders provide scripts to create the models, train, and generate predictions leveraging the correspondent datasets.
  
  *The Merged_Model folder provide scripts to create the complete model with and without pre-trained weights, train, generate predictions, and provide the visualization mechanisms(Grad-CAM and Word Weights) leveraging the Open-i dataset.
  
  *The Evaluation folder uses the predicted numpy array files generated from the previous folders and computes the multi-label evaluation metrics.
